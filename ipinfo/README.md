# ipinfo

ipinfo.exe lists known ip addresses for your computer.


## My Reasons for ipinfo

1. I don't like to think about whether I have to type `ifconfig` (OS X and Linux) or `ipconfig` (Windows) into the console to see the local IP address for my machine.
2. I always want to see my public IP address that I am using on the internet.
3. I want to see only IPv4 addresses, but if I need the IPv6 addresses, I just want to be able to display them optionally.

## Usage Exampe:

```
C:\>ipinfo
    xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx  Internet (Public)
    xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx  Ethernet
    xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx  VirtualBox Host-Only Network
    xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx  VMware Network Adapter VMnet1
    xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx  VMware Network Adapter VMnet8
    xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx  Loopback Pseudo-Interface 1
C:\>
```
With:
* The first column displays the IPv4 Address. (`xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx` is just a placeholder for this readme)
* The second column shows the name of the interface. The first line is your public internet address.
